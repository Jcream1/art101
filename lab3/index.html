		<h1>Lab 3: File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
		<p>The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure on my computer and add index.html files.</p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>It was easy after understanding these tags. For me, the most difficult thing is that my laptop was broken during <br/>the period of quarantine. I have to do my assignment after the quarantine. That's why I submit this assignment <br/>so late. </p>

		<h2>Result</h2>
		<p>What you are looking is my work. Here is the file structure:</p>
